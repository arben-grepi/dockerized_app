Use the `git clone` command to pull the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/arben-grepi/dockerized_app.git &&
cd dockerized_app

```

**Make sure Docker Desktop (or your Docker service) is running before you start.**

**Source Code**
If you want to view the source code for the application and check out the frontend and backend folders that are stored in the Github, navigate to the `SourceCode` folder in the root directory.

**When you are in the dockerized_app directory and can start pulling the containers from Dockerhub**

Pulls the latest version of the backend image from Docker Hub to your local machine.
`docker pull arbengrepi/julkinen:backend`

Pulls the latest version of the frontend image from Docker Hub to your local machine.
`docker pull arbengrepi/julkinen:frontend`

Starts the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file in detached mode, allowing the terminal to be used for other commands while the containers run in the background.
`docker-compose up -d`

**The frontend uses Nginx and is mapped to port 3000.**
`http://localhost:3000/`

**When you are done**
Stop the containers first before removing them. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. Stop **all** running containers:

   `docker stop $(docker ps -q)`

2. Then, remove **all** containers:

   `docker rm $(docker ps -aq)`
